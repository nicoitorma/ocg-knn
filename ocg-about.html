      <h2>Welcome to Online Career Guidance!</h2>
      <b>A Thesis Project Presented to the Faculty of the College of Information and Communications Technology Catanduanes State University Virac, Catanduanes</b>
      <p class="indented-paragraph"> The Online Career Guidance system is a powerful tool that can provide guidance and support to students in making important decisions about their future careers. The career recommendation functionality of an Online Career Guidance system is one of the most important features. It allows students to retrieve their semestral grades from the requested Online COG system as well as enter their grades using the manual mode. Based on the student's grades, the system can provide recommendations on career paths that may be a good fit using the KNN algorithm. By providing career recommendations and career-oriented certifications or skills, the system can help students make informed decisions about their future careers.</p>
      <p>An efficient machine learning technique for classification and prediction problems is the KNN algorithm. KNN can be used to suggest careers to students in the context of an online career guidance system based on their prior academic performance.</p>    
      <h3>Key Features:</h3>
      <p>1. Predict a suitable career path for the student of CICT using the KNN Algorithm.</p>
      <p>2. Have an insight on what skills and certifications to take to enhance employability in the market further.</p>
      <p>3. Rate the prediction to further improve the algorithm. </p>      
      <hr>
      <p>If it helps you gain insight into your future career, please rate the prediction to further improve the algorithm.</p>
