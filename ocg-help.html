      <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p class="indented-paragraph"> The CICT Online Career Guidance system is a powerful tool that can provide guidance and support to students in making important decisions about their future careers. The career recommendation functionality of an Online Career Guidance system is one of the most important features. It allows students to retrieve their semestral grades from the requested Online COG system as well as enter their grades using the manual mode. Based on the student's grades, the system can provide recommendations on career paths that may be a good fit using the KNN algorithm. By providing career recommendations and career-oriented certifications or skills, the system can help students make informed decisions about their future careers.</p>
